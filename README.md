# Webbit

A _nearly_ full-featured Reddit clone built with Ruby on Rails. This app is the result of a course called Hello Rails found at [hellorails.io](https://hellorails.io)

## Modeling

Each model will be responsible for different data throughout the app.

- User - focused on the user
- Submission - The user authors. Has different types (image/video, text, link)
- Community - the category the submission belongs to
- Comment - a response given to the submission from another user or the current user.
- Subscription - Not to be confused with billing of any type. A user can subscribe and unsubscribe to a community.
